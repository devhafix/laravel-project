Part 2: Laravel Folder Structure

app: This directory is considered the core of any Laravel application. It houses essential components such as models, controllers, and providers, all of which contribute to the overall application logic.

bootstrap: This directory contains scripts that bootstrap, or initiate, the Laravel framework. This includes the autoloader and the application start file.

config: All configuration files for the Laravel application are located in this directory. These files are essential for managing various settings throughout the application.

database: This directory houses database-related files, including migrations and seeds. Migrations provide a form of version control for the database schema, while seeds allow for the insertion of initial data into the database.

public: The public directory serves as the application's document root. It initiates the Laravel application and handles autoloading.

resources: This directory contains views, raw assets such as LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript, and localization files. These elements are essential for the front-end aspect of the application.

routes: The routes directory contains all route definitions for the application. These routes determine how an application responds to client requests.

storage: This directory is used for storing compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework during runtime.

tests: All automated tests for the application are stored in this directory.

vendor: This directory holds all Composer dependencies. Composer is a tool used for dependency management in PHP, and its dependencies are stored here.
